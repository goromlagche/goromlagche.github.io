Hi :wave:, I'm Mrinmoy.

Remote Independent Consultant helping organizations, across the globe build better web applications, create impactful MVPs and optimize for value with legacy codebases. I have worked with organizations from 6 different countries across 3 different continents to date.

I'm a polyglot familiar with a wide array of tech stacks. Primarily working with Ruby and its ecosystem, I also have worked with java, golang, elixir, and python in prior roles. I believe in writing clean, readable, simple code and refactoring for performance as and when necessary.
