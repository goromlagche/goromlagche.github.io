<br>
As a consultant, I have worked with small to medium startups, across multiple domains, working on web applications, building MVPs, optimizing, and fixing existing codebase.

I believe in writing clean, readable, simple code and refactoring for performance as and when necessary.

I have primarily worked with the ruby and rails ecosystem for most of my career. Also have some experience with java, elixir, python, go, working in production systems.
